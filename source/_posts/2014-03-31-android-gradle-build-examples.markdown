Diving into the new (new? well depends on you) Android Gradle build system may be a scary experience when you are used to the good old Eclipse ADT environment.  
But really, the Android Gradle system is worth it, it has SO MUCH to give you!

### Samples exist

The documentation is not perfect yet and you may think that there is a lack of examples/samples on Ze Internet.  
So if you haven't found what you want on the the [Android Gradle Plugin User guide][1], maybe it worth having a look at the **bottom** of the [New build system page][2], where some samples are available in Zip files.

Another good resource is the Git repo of the build system, in the **tests folder** you will find plenty of [Android gradle build examples][3], which are actually gathered in the archives available at the bottom of the [New build system page][2], previously cited.
